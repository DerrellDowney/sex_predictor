## Neural Network which predicts sex based off of height and weight
## Credit given in the .py and .ipynb files

## Future work
### - Improve results (currently very inconsistent)
### - Add a way to include the 'Index' category to improve results
### - Improve the neural network
### - Add user input to enter weight and height information 

## Current Problems
### - Not enough accuracy; can identify F but not M
### - Cannot include the other indexes
